# Implementation Plan: E-Commerce Platform with Catalog, Shopping Cart, and Order Management

**Branch**: `001-e-commerce-platform` | **Date**: 2025-09-30 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-e-commerce-platform/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from file system structure or context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI, `QWEN.md` for Qwen Code or `AGENTS.md` for opencode).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
This feature implements a headless e-commerce platform with two microservices: (1) a customer-facing service providing catalog browsing, shopping cart, and checkout APIs, and (2) an order management service that processes orders asynchronously via Kafka events. The system supports manager-based catalog CRUD operations, guest checkout (no customer authentication), and demonstrates event-driven architecture with mocked payment processing (Stripe-compatible interface). Built for local development with cloud deployment readiness, the platform prioritizes resilience patterns and observability for production-grade demonstration.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: Java 21 (Spring Boot 3.x LTS)  
**Primary Dependencies**: Spring Boot 3.x, Spring Data JPA, Spring Web, Spring Kafka, Resilience4j, Micrometer, Spring Boot Actuator, SpringDoc OpenAPI  
**Storage**: PostgreSQL (primary for both services), Redis (session-based cart caching in customer service)  
**Messaging**: Apache Kafka (Redpanda for local development) for OrderCreated and PaymentCompleted events  
**Testing**: JUnit 5, Mockito, Spring Boot Test, Testcontainers (PostgreSQL, Kafka), REST Assured  
**Target Platform**: JVM (Docker containers) - local Docker Compose initially, cloud-ready (Kubernetes)  
**Project Type**: Microservices (2 services: customer-facing-service, order-management-service)  
**Performance Goals**: <500ms p95 latency for catalog/cart operations, <30s end-to-end order processing, 100 concurrent sessions  
**Constraints**: Headless (API-only, no frontend), event-driven architecture, local development environment, demonstration scale (not production scale initially)  
**Scale/Scope**: 1,000 products, 1,000 orders/day, 100 concurrent users (demonstration scale)

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

### Principle I: Java & Spring Boot Stack
- [x] Backend implemented in Java with Spring Boot latest LTS (3.x)
- [x] Dependencies managed via Maven or Gradle
- [x] No non-Java backend services introduced

### Principle II: Resilience First
- [x] Circuit breakers planned for external service calls (Resilience4j) - Payment service integration
- [x] Timeout policies defined for network operations - Kafka, HTTP, database operations
- [x] Retry strategies with exponential backoff designed - Kafka consumers, payment processing
- [x] Health checks (liveness/readiness) endpoints planned - Spring Boot Actuator endpoints
- [x] Fallback mechanisms identified for critical features - Payment failures handled gracefully

### Principle III: 12-Factor App Methodology
- [x] Configuration externalized (no hardcoded config) - application.yml with environment variables
- [x] Services designed as stateless processes - Session data in Redis, no server state
- [x] Logs directed to stdout/stderr (not files) - Logback configuration to console
- [x] Environment parity maintained (dev/staging/prod) - Docker Compose locally, Kubernetes for cloud
- [x] Dependencies explicitly declared - Maven pom.xml with explicit versions

### Principle IV: Test-First Development
- [x] Contract tests defined before implementation - OpenAPI contracts first
- [x] Integration tests planned for critical paths - Checkout flow, order processing
- [x] TDD workflow followed (Red-Green-Refactor) - Write failing tests first
- [x] 80%+ coverage target set for business logic - Service and controller layers

### Principle V: API-First Design
- [x] OpenAPI specification created before coding - Phase 1 generates contracts/
- [x] API versioning strategy defined (e.g., /api/v1/) - All endpoints under /api/v1/
- [x] RESTful conventions followed - Resource-oriented endpoints, proper HTTP verbs
- [x] Backward compatibility plan documented - Versioned APIs, no breaking changes

### Principle VI: Observability & Monitoring
- [x] Structured logging with correlation IDs planned - SLF4J with MDC for request tracing
- [x] Prometheus metrics exposure designed - Micrometer registry, /actuator/prometheus endpoint
- [x] Distributed tracing implementation planned (OpenTelemetry) - Trace orders across services
- [x] Business metrics identified - Orders created, payments completed, cart conversions
- [x] SLIs/SLOs defined with alerting strategy - <500ms p95, <30s order processing, 99.9% uptime

### Principle VII: Security by Design
- [x] Authentication mechanism specified (OAuth 2.0/OIDC) - Manager endpoints use JWT tokens
- [x] Authorization model defined (RBAC) - Manager role for catalog CRUD, guest for shopping
- [x] Data encryption strategy planned (at rest and in transit) - TLS for APIs, encrypted DB connections
- [x] Input validation approach defined (Bean Validation) - @Valid annotations with JSR-380
- [x] Secrets management solution identified (no secrets in code) - Environment variables, Spring Cloud Config

**Structure Decision**: Multi-module Maven project with two microservices (customer-facing-service, order-management-service) communicating via Kafka. Each service is independently deployable with its own database schema, follows hexagonal architecture principles (controllers → services → repositories), and includes comprehensive test coverage. Infrastructure managed via Docker Compose locally, with Kubernetes manifests for future cloud deployment. Shared event schemas may be extracted to a shared library if reuse justifies the additional module complexity.

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - For each user action → endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - One test file per endpoint
   - Assert request/response schemas
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Each story → integration test scenario
   - Quickstart test = story validation steps

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh cursor`
     **IMPORTANT**: Execute it exactly as specified above. Do not add or remove any arguments.
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
1. **Infrastructure Setup Tasks** (Priority 1):
   - Set up parent POM with dependency management
   - Create Docker Compose infrastructure file
   - Set up PostgreSQL Flyway migrations (both services)
   - Configure Kafka topics

2. **Contract Test Tasks** (Priority 2, TDD approach):
   - Customer Service: Category endpoints contract tests [P]
   - Customer Service: Product endpoints contract tests [P]
   - Customer Service: Cart endpoints contract tests [P]
   - Customer Service: Checkout endpoint contract tests [P]
   - Order Service: Order endpoints contract tests [P]
   - Kafka: OrderCreatedEvent contract tests [P]
   - Kafka: PaymentCompletedEvent contract tests [P]

3. **Entity & Repository Tasks** (Priority 3):
   - Customer Service: Category, Product entities + repositories [P]
   - Customer Service: Cart, CartItem entities + repositories [P]
   - Order Service: Order, OrderItem entities + repositories [P]
   - Order Service: PaymentTransaction entity + repository [P]

4. **Service Layer Tasks** (Priority 4):
   - Customer Service: CatalogService (CRUD operations)
   - Customer Service: CartService (add/update/remove items)
   - Customer Service: CheckoutService (order creation, Kafka publishing)
   - Order Service: OrderProcessingService (event consumer logic)
   - Order Service: PaymentService (mock implementation)

5. **Controller/API Tasks** (Priority 5):
   - Customer Service: CategoryController [P]
   - Customer Service: ProductController [P]
   - Customer Service: CartController [P]
   - Customer Service: CheckoutController [P]
   - Order Service: OrderController [P]

6. **Event Processing Tasks** (Priority 6):
   - Customer Service: OrderCreatedEvent publisher
   - Order Service: OrderCreatedEvent consumer (idempotency handling)
   - Order Service: PaymentCompletedEvent publisher/consumer

7. **Resilience & Observability Tasks** (Priority 7):
   - Configure Resilience4j circuit breakers (payment service)
   - Configure retry policies (Kafka, database)
   - Set up structured logging with correlation IDs
   - Configure Micrometer metrics
   - Set up Spring Boot Actuator health checks

8. **Integration Test Tasks** (Priority 8):
   - End-to-end checkout flow test (Testcontainers)
   - Order processing flow test (Kafka, PostgreSQL)
   - Cart expiration test (Redis TTL)
   - Payment failure handling test

9. **Documentation & Deployment Tasks** (Priority 9):
   - Write README with quickstart instructions
   - Create environment variable templates (.env.example)
   - Write Dockerfiles for both services
   - Create Kubernetes manifests (future deployment)

**Ordering Strategy**:
- **TDD Workflow**: Contract tests → Entities → Services → Controllers → Integration tests
- **Dependency Order**: Infrastructure → Data layer → Business logic → API layer → End-to-end tests
- **Parallel Execution**: Tasks marked [P] can be executed simultaneously (independent files/modules)
- **Service Independence**: Customer service and order service tasks can be developed in parallel after infrastructure setup

**Estimated Output**: 45-50 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**Task Granularity**:
- Each task should be completable in 1-4 hours
- Large features split into multiple tasks (e.g., ProductController CRUD → 4 tasks: Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- Tests always precede implementation (Red-Green-Refactor)

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
