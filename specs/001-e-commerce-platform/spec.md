# Feature Specification: E-Commerce Platform with Catalog, Shopping Cart, and Order Management

**Feature Branch**: `001-e-commerce-platform`  
**Created**: 2025-09-30  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "As an e-commerce manager, I want to be able to CRUD catalog items using the best possible model for an e-commerce. As a customer, I want to be able to shop (add items to the shopping card and somehow be directed to checkout). I want an order management system that is minified just for demonstration purposes. This should be implemented as two services: one for the customer-facing experience and the other for an order management system that listens to domain events coming from a Kafka topic. Please be prepared to add a third-party payment processor like Stripe to the mix, but for now, please mock it as a simpler, always successful service. Architecture is: no frontend for now... headless ecomm... event-oriented for order processing. Everything should run locally, but eventually, this will be deployed to the cloud."

- Q: Customer Information at Checkout - What information should be collected during checkout? ‚Üí A: Standard (Name, email, phone, shipping address)
- Q: Product Catalog Structure - How should the product catalog be structured? ‚Üí A: Categories only (Products organized into categories, no variants)
- Q: Cart Total Calculation - What should be included in cart total calculation? ‚Üí A: Subtotal only (Simple sum of item prices √ó quantities)
- Q: Domain Events for Order Processing - Which events should the system publish? ‚Üí A: Minimal (OrderCreated, PaymentCompleted only)

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Stories

**Story 1: E-Commerce Manager - Catalog Management**
As an e-commerce manager, I need to manage the product catalog so that customers can browse and purchase available products. I need to create new products, update existing product information, view product details, and remove discontinued products from the catalog.

**Story 2: Customer - Shopping Experience**
As a customer, I want to browse available products, add items to my shopping cart, review my cart contents, and proceed to checkout so that I can purchase products. The checkout process should collect necessary information and confirm my order.

**Story 3: System - Order Processing**
As the system, I need to receive and process customer orders asynchronously, track order status, handle payment processing (initially mocked), and provide order fulfillment information to relevant parties.

### Acceptance Scenarios

#### Catalog Management Scenarios

1. **Given** I am an authenticated e-commerce manager, **When** I create a new product with name, description, price, and inventory quantity, **Then** the product appears in the catalog and is available for customers to purchase

2. **Given** a product exists in the catalog, **When** I update its price or inventory quantity, **Then** the changes are immediately reflected for customer browsing

3. **Given** a product exists in the catalog, **When** I mark it as discontinued or delete it, **Then** it is no longer available for new customer purchases (items already in carts can still be purchased)

4. **Given** I am an authenticated manager, **When** I view the product catalog, **Then** I see all products including their current inventory levels and sales status

#### Shopping Cart Scenarios

5. **Given** I am a customer viewing available products, **When** I add a product to my shopping cart, **Then** the item is added with quantity and the cart total is updated

6. **Given** I have items in my shopping cart, **When** I increase or decrease item quantities, **Then** the cart totals are recalculated correctly

7. **Given** I have items in my shopping cart, **When** I remove an item, **Then** it is no longer in my cart and totals are updated

8. **Given** I have items in my cart, **When** I proceed to checkout, **Then** I am guided through the checkout process to provide name, email, phone, and shipping address

9. **Given** I have items in my cart from a previous session, **When** I return to the site, **Then** my cart is not persisted (guest checkout model - each session is independent)

#### Checkout & Order Processing Scenarios

10. **Given** I complete the checkout process, **When** I submit my order, **Then** I receive an order confirmation with order number and status

11. **Given** an order has been submitted, **When** payment processing is triggered, **Then** the order status is updated to reflect payment success or failure

12. **Given** an order is successfully paid, **When** the order management system processes it, **Then** order details are available for fulfillment tracking

13. **Given** an order has been created, **When** I check order status, **Then** I can see current order state (pending, processing, paid, fulfilled, cancelled)

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a customer tries to add more items to cart than available inventory?
- What happens if inventory is depleted between adding to cart and checkout?
- How does the system handle concurrent updates to the same product by multiple managers?
- What happens if payment processing fails during checkout?
- What happens to incomplete checkouts or abandoned carts? (Session-based, cleaned up when session expires)
- How are pricing errors or discrepancies handled?
- What happens when a customer tries to checkout with an empty cart?
- How does the system handle duplicate order submissions (double-click scenarios)?

### Architecture Evolution (forward-looking)

- Adopt transactional outbox pattern for domain event publishing from customer-facing service to guarantee atomic persistence of state changes and event emission without relying on synchronous Kafka sends inside database transactions.
- Standardize error responses on RFC 7807 Problem Details using Spring Boot 3 `ProblemDetail`, replacing custom error DTOs for simpler, uniform error handling across services.
- Introduce idempotent checkout via client-provided `Idempotency-Key` header, persisted server-side to prevent duplicate order submissions and double inventory decrements.
- Replace in-memory order number sequencing with a database-backed daily sequence to ensure uniqueness across instances and restarts.
- Make Redis optional via Spring profiles (dev/demo uses Redis; tests can run with in-memory cart adapter) to simplify local developer ergonomics.
- Strengthen Kafka consumer error handling using a dead-letter topic (DLT) and backoff policies; expose DLQ metrics and a remediation runbook.
- Propagate `correlationId` consistently via an HTTP filter, Kafka headers, and MDC to trace requests end-to-end across services and events.

### New/Amended Functional Requirements

- FR-041: System MUST publish `OrderCreated` via a transactional outbox to ensure exactly-once handoff between DB and Kafka.
- FR-042: System MUST expose errors as RFC 7807 Problem Details with stable `type` URLs and actionable `detail`.
- FR-043: System MUST support idempotent checkout requests using `Idempotency-Key` with a minimum 24h deduplication window.
- FR-044: System MUST generate order numbers via a database-backed daily sequence ensuring uniqueness across instances.
- FR-045: System SHOULD provide a DLQ for failed Kafka messages and operational procedures to replay or purge.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Category**: Represents a product classification for organization and browsing. Key attributes: unique identifier, name, description, timestamps (created, updated). Relationships: contains multiple products

- **Shopping Cart**: Represents a customer's collection of items intended for purchase. Key attributes: unique identifier, session association, cart items (product references with quantities), subtotal (calculated), timestamps. Relationships: contains multiple cart items

- **Cart Item**: Represents a single product entry in a shopping cart. Key attributes: product reference, quantity, price snapshot (at time of adding). Relationships: belongs to one cart, references one product

- **Order**: Represents a customer's purchase request. Key attributes: unique order number, customer information, order items, subtotal (sum of item prices √ó quantities), order status, timestamps (created, updated, completed). Relationships: contains multiple order items

- **Order Item**: Represents a product included in an order. Key attributes: product reference, quantity, price snapshot, subtotal. Relationships: belongs to one order, references one product

- **Customer Information**: Represents guest customer data collected at checkout (not a persistent user entity). Key attributes: name (first and last), email, phone number, shipping address (street, city, state/province, postal code, country). Captured per order, not stored as customer profile
