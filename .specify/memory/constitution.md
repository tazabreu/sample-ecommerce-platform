# E-Commerce Platform Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Java & Spring Boot Stack (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

All backend services MUST be implemented using Java with Spring Boot latest LTS version (currently 3.x series). This principle ensures:

- **Consistency**: Single language and framework across all backend services
- **Maintainability**: Team expertise consolidated in one ecosystem
- **Enterprise Readiness**: Spring Boot provides production-grade features out of the box
- **Long-term Support**: LTS versions guarantee stability and security updates

**Rationale**: Java and Spring Boot provide the enterprise-grade foundation required for scalable, maintainable e-commerce systems with extensive community support and proven patterns.

### II. Resilience First (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

Every service and feature MUST be designed and implemented with resilience as the primary concern. This includes:

- **Circuit breakers**: Implement using Resilience4j for all external service calls
- **Timeouts**: Define and enforce timeout policies for all network operations
- **Retries**: Implement exponential backoff retry strategies with jitter
- **Bulkheads**: Isolate resources to prevent cascade failures
- **Fallbacks**: Provide graceful degradation paths for non-critical features
- **Health checks**: Implement comprehensive health endpoints (liveness, readiness)

**Rationale**: E-commerce systems require high availability; resilience patterns prevent single points of failure and ensure graceful degradation under load or partial system failures.

### III. 12-Factor App Methodology (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

All applications MUST strictly adhere to the 12-Factor App principles:

1. **Codebase**: One codebase tracked in Git, many deploys
2. **Dependencies**: Explicitly declare and isolate dependencies (Maven/Gradle)
3. **Config**: Store config in environment variables, never in code
4. **Backing Services**: Treat backing services as attached resources
5. **Build, Release, Run**: Strictly separate build and run stages
6. **Processes**: Execute as stateless processes
7. **Port Binding**: Export services via port binding
8. **Concurrency**: Scale out via the process model
9. **Disposability**: Fast startup and graceful shutdown
10. **Dev/Prod Parity**: Keep environments as similar as possible
11. **Logs**: Treat logs as event streams (stdout/stderr)
12. **Admin Processes**: Run admin/management tasks as one-off processes

**Rationale**: 12-Factor methodology ensures applications are cloud-native, scalable, and maintainable across environments, critical for modern e-commerce platforms.

### IV. API-First Design

All features exposing functionality MUST follow API-first design:

- **OpenAPI Specification**: Define APIs using OpenAPI 3.0+ before implementation
- **Contract Review**: API contracts reviewed and approved before coding
- **Versioning**: APIs MUST include version in path (e.g., `/api/v1/`)
- **RESTful Principles**: Follow REST conventions (resource-oriented, proper HTTP methods)
- **Backward Compatibility**: Breaking changes require MAJOR version bump

**Rationale**: API-first ensures contracts are well-designed, documented, and agreed upon before investment in implementation.

### VI. Observability & Monitoring

Production readiness requires comprehensive observability:

- **Structured Logging**: Use JSON-formatted logs with correlation IDs
- **Metrics**: Expose Prometheus-compatible metrics (RED method: Rate, Errors, Duration)
- **Distributed Tracing**: Implement OpenTelemetry for request tracing
- **Business Metrics**: Track business KPIs (orders, revenue, cart abandonment)
- **Alerting**: Define SLIs/SLOs with actionable alerts

**Rationale**: E-commerce systems require real-time visibility into system health and business metrics to ensure uptime and optimize user experience.

## Technical Standards

### Technology Stack

**Backend**:
- Language: Java 21 (latest LTS)
- Framework: Spring Boot 3.x (latest LTS)
- Build Tool: Maven
- Database: PostgreSQL (primary), Redis (caching)
- Message Queue: Apache Kafka (using Redpanda)
- API Documentation: SpringDoc OpenAPI

**Testing**:
- Unit Testing: JUnit 5, Mockito
- Integration Testing: Spring Boot Test, Testcontainers
- Contract Testing: Spring Cloud Contract or Pact
- Performance Testing: Gatling or JMeter

**Observability**:
- Logging: SLF4J with Logback
- Metrics: Micrometer with Prometheus
- Tracing: OpenTelemetry
- Health Checks: Spring Boot Actuator

**Resilience**:
- Circuit Breaker: Resilience4j
- Rate Limiting: Bucket4j
- Caching: Spring Cache with Redis

### Code Quality Standards

- **Formatting**: Google Java Style Guide
- **Static Analysis**: SonarQube (Quality Gate must pass)
- **Code Reviews**: All code requires peer review before merge
- **Dependency Management**: Keep dependencies up-to-date; scan for vulnerabilities
- **Documentation**: JavaDoc for public APIs; README for each service

## Development Workflow

### Feature Development Process

1. **Specification**: Create feature spec following `/specify` command template
2. **Clarification**: Run `/clarify` to resolve ambiguities
3. **Planning**: Generate implementation plan via `/plan` command
4. **Task Generation**: Create task list via `/tasks` command
5. **Implementation**: Execute tasks following TDD principles
6. **Review**: Code review ensuring constitution compliance
7. **Deployment**: CI/CD pipeline validates and deploys

### Branch Strategy

- **Main**: Production-ready code only
- **Feature Branches**: `###-feature-name` format
- **Pull Requests**: Require approval and CI passing

### Continuous Integration

**Required CI Checks**:
- Build success (Maven/Gradle)
- Unit tests pass (80%+ coverage)
- Integration tests pass
- Static analysis (SonarQube Quality Gate)
- Security scanning (OWASP Dependency Check)
- Contract tests pass

### Deployment

**Environment Parity**:
- Development, Staging, Production environments
- Infrastructure as Code (Terraform or similar)
- Blue-green or canary deployments
- Automated rollback on health check failure

## Governance

### Amendment Procedure

1. **Proposal**: Document proposed change with rationale
2. **Discussion**: Team review and feedback period (minimum 3 days)
3. **Approval**: Requires consensus or 2/3 majority vote
4. **Migration Plan**: Document impact and migration path for breaking changes
5. **Update**: Increment version and update LAST_AMENDED_DATE
6. **Communication**: Notify all stakeholders of changes

### Version Policy

- **MAJOR**: Backward incompatible changes (e.g., removing a core principle)
- **MINOR**: Additive changes (e.g., new principle or significant guidance expansion)
- **PATCH**: Clarifications, wording improvements, non-semantic refinements

### Compliance Review

- **Pull Requests**: All PRs MUST verify constitution compliance
- **Architecture Reviews**: New services reviewed against principles
- **Retrospectives**: Quarterly review of constitution effectiveness
- **Justification Required**: Deviations MUST be documented in Complexity Tracking section of plan.md

### Enforcement

- Constitution supersedes all other practices and preferences
- Non-compliance blocks merge unless explicitly justified
- Team leads responsible for ensuring adherence
- Complexity must always be justified against simpler alternatives
